### Datasets Preparation
We integrated a new dataset "MOSE+" to improve the performance of the model in the training phase
The dataset "MOSE+" can be downloaded from [this link of BaiduPan]( https://pan.baidu.com/s/1pVRdRqkbX5gKf83YwnVc8Q?pwd=wc7n). Please place it in the `data` folder and confirm the file structure as follows:
```
MASSeg

       |- Annotations
       |- moseplus.txt
    |- Training
    |- tools
